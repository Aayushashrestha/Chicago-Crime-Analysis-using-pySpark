# Chicago Crime Analysis Using Big Data
## Masters in Science, Computer Science

This project aims to analyze crime patterns and trends in the city of Chicago using PySpark, a popular big data processing framework, and machine learning techniques. The project utilizes the "Crimes-2001 to Present" dataset, which is publicly available on the Chicago Data Portal and contains comprehensive information about reported crimes in Chicago from 2001 to 2021.

### Obejctive 
Predicting the type of crime in Chicago.

### Dataset
For our project, we utilized the "Crimes-2001 to Present" dataset, which is publicly available on the Chicago Data Portal. This dataset comprises a comprehensive record of all the reported crimes in the city of Chicago spanning from 2001 to 2021. It includes crucial information such as the date and time of the crime, the type of crime committed, the location of the crime (including street address, latitude, and longitude), the primary description of the crime, the arrest status of the offender, and the FBI code associated with the crime. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for our analysis and enables us to gain insights into crime patterns and trends in the city of Chicago.

### Technologies Used
1. **PySpark** : PySpark is a popular open-source big data processing framework that provides APIs for distributed data processing using Apache Spark. It enables efficient data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning on large datasets.    
1. **Spark MLlib**: Spark MLlib is a machine learning library that is part of the Apache Spark ecosystem. It provides a wide range of machine learning algorithms, tools, and utilities for scalable and distributed machine learning tasks.    

### Project Goals
The main objectives of this project are:  

1. Analyze crime statistics to identify patterns and trends in the city of Chicago.     
1. Utilize PySpark for efficient data processing and analysis of the "Crimes-2001 to Present" dataset.    
1. Apply machine learning techniques, such as Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors, to discover and study crime trends.      
1. Compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms using metrics such as F1 Score and accuracy.      

### Project Workflow
1. **Data Preparation**: The "Crimes-2001 to Present" dataset is loaded into PySpark for data preparation, which includes cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering tasks. This step involves handling missing values, converting data types, and extracting relevant features.    
 
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: EDA is performed to gain insights into the dataset and understand crime patterns and trends in Chicago. This step involves visualizations, statistical analysis, and data summarization.      

1. **Machine Learning**: PySpark's MLlib is used to apply machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors, on the prepared dataset. These algorithms are trained and evaluated using appropriate metrics such as F1 Score and accuracy.    
 
1. **Model Comparison**: The performance of different machine learning algorithms is compared to identify the best-performing model for crime analysis in Chicago.    

1. **Results and Conclusion**: The findings and insights obtained from the analysis are summarized, and conclusions are drawn based on the results. Recommendations for further improvements and future directions are provided.
